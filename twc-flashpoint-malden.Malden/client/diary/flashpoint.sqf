player createDiaryRecord ["flashpoint",["Roles","There are 3 squads of infantry, these squads should stick together as much as possible and operate as a unit. The squads are lead by their respective section commanders, with 2nd-in-command to assist the commanders. There are also special roles, like pilot and armour crew. These should support and co-operate with the infantry. As armour crew, you need all 3 roles filled before you can operate. Crew Chiefs for helicopters need a pilot before they can operate."]];

player createDiaryRecord ["flashpoint",["Welcome","Welcome to TWC Flashpoint. This is TWC's take on a large CTI scale mission. In TWC Flashpoint you are to capture the island from hostiles that will reinforce themselves, attempt to recapture zones, and patrol around. The general goal is to make a more enjoyable domination experience where enemies do not just wait to be killed. You also have to balance civilian opinions or else flashpoint is going to turn into an insurgency."]];
